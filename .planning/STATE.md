## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: CBOE (no-auth) feeds journal before Schwab OAuth (Phase 2 → Phase 3 sequencing)
- Roadmap: BSM engine (Phase 2) precedes snapshot job (Phase 3) — snapshots store computed greeks
- Roadmap: MCP-02 is a cross-cutting constraint established in Phase 1; every use-case ships both HTTP + MCP adapters from day one
- [Phase ?]: emitDeclarationOnly instead of noEmit — TypeScript project references require composite packages to emit .d.ts files
- [Phase ?]: boundaries/dependencies (v6 rename) + **/packages/*/src/** patterns with mode:full — absolute path matching required for Bun monorepo ESLint integration
